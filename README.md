Code used in *Tuberculosis resistance acquisition in space and time: an analysis of globally diverse M. tuberculosis whole genome sequences* by Yasha Ektefaie, Avika Dixit, Luca Freschi, Maha Farhat

## Methods Section

**Molecular dating of resistance aquisition** was automated and performed via scripts in a seperate repository https://github.com/farhat-lab/analysis_pipeline

**Resistance Mutations** were collected in *vcfmatchunk.py*

**Commercial/WGS tests** were conducted in *treatment_program_rcm.py*



## Results Section

The following sections of the results were calculated via scripts in *conditions.py*:
1. Data and global lineage distribution
2. Phenotypic resistance distribution
3. Molecular dating of Resistance Acquisition
4. Distribution of Resistance Mutations

The following section of the results were calculated via scripts in *treatment_program_rcm.py*:
1. Distribution of Resistance Mutations
